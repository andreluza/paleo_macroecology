Ecological innovation appear, redundancy increase for strategies that work (conferring fit to the environment), and extinctions erode variability to once again spur innovations (Novack-Gottshall 2016). Detecting changes in the patterns of ecological space area and occupation over time and across taxa has been central to infer the role of ecological innovations, competition, environmental drivers, and significant events (e.g., mass extinctions) on taxon occurrence and persistence over the geological time (Bambach et al. 2007). 'Ecospace' is the multivariate (or multi-dimensional) representation of the overall variation and distribution of taxa across combinations of ecological traits (Bush & Novack-Gottshall 2011, https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0641; Vill√©ger et al. 2011). In a pioneering study with ecospace and ecological guilds in paleontological data, Bambach (1983) showed significant expansion of the ecospace by marine taxa during the Phanerozoic, due to the increased number of ecological guilds arising within  paleocommunities. More recently, Reeves et al (2020) analysed ecological space occupation by six marine taxa (x,x,x,x,x,x) and found that the ecological space shrunk during the mass extinctions at Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic boundaries, and expanded in subsequent times. They also showed which ecological strategies persisted after extinctions, and what was the degree of ecological overlap between taxa. Ecospace dynamics resulted more extreme / different morphologies getting extinct and resulting in a contraction of the morpho/ecospace (Ciampaglio et al. 2001, Reeves et al. 2020). Remaining taxa comprise the baseline for subsequent diversification. The approach can reveal XXXXXXXXXXX. Analysis like these remain to be done in deep time of terrestrial ecosystems.

The Triassic in Western Pangea was marked by the ascencion of XX and the fall of XX. Major drivers were the global Carnian Pluvial Event (Dal Corso et al. 2020) which might correlate with the fall/local extinction of Pseudosuchians and  Dicynodonts, and the ascension of some Cynodontia and Dinosauria (REF). ANOTHER EVENT?. Altough declines in species richness were detected, less clear is how the occupancy of the ecospace among these groups, and how the ascencion on one group (e.g., Dinosauria) might be related to the fall of others (e.g. Pseudosuchia, Cynodontia) remains to be revealed. Would they overlap somewhat in time (ecological canalization) and get specialized in the same set of resources, with subsequent ecological differentiation or extinction mediated by competition (Novack-Gottshall 2016b)?. Would these occupancy patterns differ from a neutral evolutionary models where variation in ecological attributes passively increases  with time (ie. without an ecological driver)? Ot of   Niche contraction, expansion and occupancy can be detected by ecospace analyses (Villeger et al. 2011, Novack-Gottshall 2016a).

In Paleontology, ecospace analysis often involves discreticing ecological traits into combinations of categorical traits (Bambach et al. 2007). In this approach, the ecospace is segmented into bins, and these bins are filled if occupied by taxa. The number of bins occupied over time is a proxy of ecospace occupancy (). Yet it is a great approach to unveil which ecological-trait combinations are biologically allowed [adaptive] or forbidden, it fails to how densely occupied is the ecospace (but see Bush et al. 2007 for a similar approach using the abundance of ecological types, yet one species could concentrate most abudance within a trait combination).

Show constraints along diversification, and compare groups might show whether ecospace occupancy by one taxon constraint the ecological expansion of other taxa.

In this study, we examined how the ecospace use/occupancy and area changed along the middle to the end Triassic, a phase that represented a turning point that lead to the modern fauna due to the Carnial Pluvial Event and the mass extinction at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (Dal Corso et al. 2020, Bentos 1995 - REF TRiassic extinction). We analyzed these changes by setting different questions: 

i) Has ecospace use increased through time? 
ii) If so, was such an increase equal to different taxa? In other words, were temporal trends in ecospace occupancy similar across groups?
iii) Were patterns of ecospace occupancy only determined by random ecological variation over time (as predicted by a Brownian motion model) or instead driven by ecological factors?
iv) Are trends in the utilization of ecospace linked to trends in alpha diversity (i.e. species richness)?

We expected that ecospace increased over time (i), but such an increase differed between taxa (ii). WHY? We expected that patterns of ecospace occupancy and area were driven by ecological factors for any group, a byproduct of important events during the studied period (the Carnian Pluvial Event and the mass extinction) (iii). Finally, we expected more ecospace use at higher levels of richness, although the increase in ecospace use should differ across groups due to competition (or other process) that for instance constrained the occurrence and diversification of Cynodontia when competing with Dinosauria.


Methods

We assembled a dataset of occurrences and ecological traits of Cynodontia, Pseudosuchia, Dicynodontia, and Dinosauria based on literature and expert knowledge (see Online Supporting Information S1). 
The dataset include XXX species/genus/taxa sampled through the Triassic (XXX intervals), and XXXX ecological traits (Table 1 - table with traits and levels per trait). 

% of missing data - PCO volume has low to medium sensitivity to % missing data < 25%. Very sensitive to an increased number of traits (Ciampaglio et al. 2001). 

ecospace quality following Maire et al. (2015).

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
