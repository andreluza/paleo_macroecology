Spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of Cynodontia.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%",out.height = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here ("output","animation_data.gif"))
```
*Animation: data distribution over space and time. Might have a mismatch between records and land position because land position was defined at the middle of each stage. Paleontological map model: Golonka model*
